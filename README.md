# Tech-Interview-Questions
These are some sample set of questions which you can ask candidates in an interview. I have also provided a working solution for each question. Please note that there might be some edge cases (especially input validations) which I have purposely not included so as to not enlongate the solution. 

The main focus of this is the business logic of the soltion. Feel free to contribute more to this.
